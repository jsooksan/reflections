1. We can use a diff command on Macs or linux to compare 2 files
2. diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
3. on Windows use fc command

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Ans: Can go back to the previous working version if needed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Ans: Pros -- Manually choosing commit can save work at logical point
     Cons -- Manually choosing commit can be dangerous if not done often enough
             (e.g., if the changes are too big)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Ans: In some situations, files are inter-related, so it would be nice to be able to save multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Ans: Use git log to browse through the commits, and find the ID of the commit that we want.
     Then use git diff to compare the ID of the current commit with the previous commit. That is git diff current_commit_id previous_commit_id
     If the id is too long, can only type the first 4 letters

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Ans: It gives me a confident that I can always go back to start from the most recent working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Ans: Working on writing codes
